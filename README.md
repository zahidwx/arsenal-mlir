# MLIR Arsenal Dialect

This is the minimal example to look into the way to implement the user define custom ops with MLIR. The basic code structure is borrowed from [standalone](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/mlir/examples/standalone) and [Toy language](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/mlir/examples/toy) in LLVM project.

## Prerequisites

* [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)
* [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)

We need to build our own MLIR in the local machine in advance. Please follow the build instruction for MLIR [here](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/).

## Building

Please make sure to build LLVM project first according to [the instruction](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/).

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja .. -DLLVM_DIR=/path/to/llvm-project/build/lib/cmake/llvm \
  -DMLIR_DIR=/path/to/llvm-project/build/lib/cmake/mlir

cmake --build . --target arsenal-opt
```

To run the test, `check-arsenal` target will be usable.

To build the documentation from the TableGen description of the dialect operations, run
```sh
cmake --build . --target mlir-doc
```

# 'arsenal' Dialect

_A arsenal out-of-tree MLIR dialect._

This dialect is minimal example to implement user defined custom ops
for MLIR.
